                        Classes and IDs are "attribute selectors". 
                        This means that you can attach style to HTML elements 
                        based on that element's attributes. This empowers 
                        you to apply different style to items of the same HTML 
                        type. Classes are an HTML attribute that specifies a name 
                        for a group of elements on the page. You can apply the 
                        class name to as many elements as you like, even if they are 
                        of different HTML tag types. You can use the class name with a 
                        period in front as the selector like so:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Class names must be single words</li>
                        <li class="fake-link">but you can include digits and dashes as long as the name begins 
                            with a ltter
                        </li>
                        <li>To apply a CSS rule to a class you use the class name
                            preceded by a period (".")
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        An ID is an HTML attribute that specifies a name or unique identifier 
                        a particular HTML element. They are like classes with a very important 
                        distinction: the value of the ID attribute must be unique throughout the document.
                        This lets you target a single HTML element for styling. You use the name with a
                        hashtag in front as the selector like so. ID names have the same rules as class names: 
                        start with a letter, can include numbers and dashes, no spaces. The way to create a 
                        selector for an ID is also similar to how you create a selector for a class, except 
                        you replace the period with a hash symbol ("#") like in the code below.
